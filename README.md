I wanted to put together a set of examples that could easily be run and debugged through to give an idea of how the code flows.
As such, each one of the projects in this solution are just console applications.

Yes, there could be unit tests (which I may add later) but I wanted a repo that could easily be cloned and run straight away.

Most of these have either been taken from examples or from the awesome Pluralsight course found here:
[https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/patterns-library/table-of-contents](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/patterns-library/table-of-contents)

Granted some of these are copied, pasted and refactored versions of what's on Pluralsight.
So, apologies to the authors at Pluralsight for copying and pasting your code!

However, I'm sure you'd find that after watching 15 hours of videos you'd get bored of thinking up of original domain object names for the patterns!
